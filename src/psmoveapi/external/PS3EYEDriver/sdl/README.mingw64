This simple application now works in Windows 8.1 64-bit.

Prerequisites
-------------

1. MinGW64
	I use the latest tdm64-gcc (4.9.2-3) from here: http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/download
	Add MinGW's binary to your system path (done by default when installing tdm distribution).
	
2. Optional - MSys-git
	I prefer to work in BASH instead of CMD prompt when possible.
	For this simple project, bash is only necessary to get `mingw32-make clean` to work. Everything else should work from command prompt.

3. libusb-1.0
	Download the latest Windows binaries from http://libusb.info/ (Tested with libusb-1.0.20)
	Unpack next to PS3EYEDriver.
	Rename the directory to libusb-1.0 (i.e., cut off the version number).
	See below for directory layout.
	
4. SDL2
	Download the latest Development Libraries from http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php (Tested with SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw.tar.gz)
	Unpack next to PS3EYEDriver.
	Rename the directory to SDL2.

5. A windows libusb interface to your PS3Eye
	Read here: https://github.com/libusb/libusb/wiki/Windows#How_to_use_libusb_on_Windows
	I used Zadig to install drivers for my camera. This was a little trickier than expected.
	One one system (desktop) the camera works well if I install the WinUSB drivers or the libusbK drivers.
	On another system (MacbookPro in Bootcamp), the camera works incredibly slowly using either the WinUSB or libusbK drivers. Only the libusb-win32 (lisusb0) drivers work.
	

Necessary directory structure

-PS3EYEDriver
	-src
-libusb-1.0
	-include
		-libusb-1.0
	-MinGW64
		-static
-SDL2
	-x86_64-w64-mingw32
		-bin
		-include
		-lib

Build
-----
`mingw32-make`

Use
---
You have to get libSDL2.dll on your path.
If using MSys, try `export PATH=../../SDL2/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin:$PATH`
If using command prompt, try `SET PATH=../../SDL2/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin;%PATH%`

Then run `ps3eye_sdl.exe`

Notes
-----

On both my Windows 8.1 x64 systems, libusb identifies two devices that match the PS3Eye VID and PID.
If you attempt to open the first device then the program crashes. (Maybe this is the camera's microphone, even though it is managed by a non-libusb driver?)
Only the second device works.
